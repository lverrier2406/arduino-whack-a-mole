# Arduino Whack-a-Mole Game

This "Whack-a-Mole"-style reaction game was originally developed for a class partner project. As a personal project, I redesigned it to improve reliability, responsiveness, and code structure.

## Goals
- Fix unreliable button input
- Improve timing accuracy
- Refactor code for maintainability
- Document design decisions and debugging process

## Original Project Documentation

The original classroom project report includes the schematic, hardware description, and explanation of the initial game logic.
